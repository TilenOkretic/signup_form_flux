        <h1>Where will the test rides be held?</h1>
            <p>We will organize them across Europe in locations where we received the most signups.</p>
        <h1>Will it be possible to test it outside of Europe?</h1>
            <p>Not yet at this stage, unfortunately we can’t ship or fly the Primo overseas without expensive certification.</p>
        <h1>How will you pick who gets to ride it?</h1>
            <p>We will randomly select riders of different skill levels, to get the widest opinions possible. Riders who pre-ordered will have an advantage.</p>
        <h1>Is the pre-order refundable?</h1>
            <p>Yes, anytime, no asterisk or fine print. We’re keeping it in a separate account and not using it for anything, ever. Even if the company shuts down, you will get your money back.</p>
        <h1>What is the point of the pre-order?</h1>
            <p>You’re voting with your money. You’re telling investors you want to see this product on the market and are willing to put money down to prove how serious you are about it. You are shaping the future of moto.</p>
        <h1>What will be the price of the production model?</h1>
            <p>We have a target price of 12.000€.</p>
        <h1>What is your vision?</h1>
            <p>Our goal is to build the next electric motorcycle giant, with a focus on delivering performance motorcycles that are just plain better than the gas powered competition. We’ll start that journey by building the best electric motocross, enduro and supermoto bikes in the world. </p>
    
        <h1>Does our opinion really matter?</h1>
            <p>Absolutely, talking to users is our big priority. We want you to help us make the perfect bike for your needs.</p>
    
        <h1>What is your plan?</h1>
            <p>The production motorcycle will be built from the ground up by a wide team of experienced engineers. No retrofits or patchwork - every part built for the purpose of being the best electric dirtbike out there. 
        The Primo will be a test bed and technological platform. With it we will develop the electronics and try different solutions - digital and physical. 
        We will get feedback from testing with you and integrate that in the development of the production motorcycle.
        We will also get data - power profiles and sensor outputs. With that we can design a better powertrain and use AI to process the data of different riders and conditions.
        All with a single goal in mind: produce the best motorcycle.</p>
    
        <h1>Why haven’t you declared the range for the Primo?</h1>
            <p>The electric vehicle market is full of ridiculous range claims that don’t come anywhere close to reality. We respect you as a customer and don’t want to do that. We will get real power consumption data by testing with you. That way, when we release our production motorcycle, you know the ranges are based on real user experience, not marketing hype. </p>
